# My-XAMPP-Website-Project
This is a simple website project developed using XAMPP as a local server environment.

This project is a simple website developed and hosted locally using XAMPP. It consists of multiple interconnected pages built with HTML, CSS, and PHP to demonstrate basic web development concepts and page navigation.

The website runs on a local Apache server provided by XAMPP, allowing for testing and development without the need for an online hosting service.

The main goal of this project is to practice setting up a local web server environment and creating a functional website with links between pages.
